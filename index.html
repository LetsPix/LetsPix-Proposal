				The LetsPix application will allow users to access a library 
				of movies from a variety of media service providers. Movies 
				and TV shows from subscription services such as Netflix, Amazon 
				Prime Video, and Hulu will be discoverable through a variety 
				of methods. The main goal of this application is to provide 
				users a way to examine a variety of movies and TV shows while 
				quickly accessing where one can watch said media from a variety 
				of genres and media providers. 
			</td>
			<!-- Technology Overview -->
			<td>
				The LetsPix application will employ a few key technologies. 
				Most importantly, we will be using HTML and Bootstrap (CSS) 
				to present movies to users on a static client oriented website. 
				We will also be utilizing a MongoDB Atlas database to hold 
				movie information. We will also be utilizing an API format for 
				retrieving movie information from the database to avoid loading 
				excess information onto user devices. This movie information will 
				be formatted using JSON. To facilitate having different client and 
				server environments, we will also be employing node and express.

				We are testing our application using Netflix as our main streaming services
				to be able to to run adequete testing. Before we deliver our final project, our future plans are
				to add other stremaing services such as Hulu and Amazon Prime Video. We want the user to 
				be able to eventually filter out different generes from the different streaming platforms we're 
				providing. We would also like to be able to filter the total list of available media of a service based 
				on the alphabet, popularity, or reception so that the user can navigate all options. Our goal is to soon develop
				a way for the user to create an account through our application to be able to set and save their streaming service 
				preferences, and change settings within our applications to update any security settings to their liking. With the account, 
				we would like to have a navigation bar that will send the user to their personal account page which will hold the 
				information and options of the account.
